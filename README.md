# Text-Generation-Model
Project Overview:

In this project, I generate text to use KerasNLP to load a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) - GPT-2 model and generate text based on users' input (also known as prompt).

Project Steps:

- First we Import Packages.
- Then pre-trained GPT-2 Model Loading
- After that just Generate Text.

Local Setup:

- import os
- import keras_nlp
- import keras
- import tensorflow as tf
- import time
